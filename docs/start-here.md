## Getting started

So, we're going to make a LED blink by using and AVR microcontroller. How hard can it be, right? It's actully not that hard but involves quite a few steps. You need to:

1. buy an in-system programmer (or use your Arduino UNO)
2. make sure you have all parts needed
3. [build the curcuit](build-circuit.md)
4. [hookup the programmer (Arduino UNO)](hookup-programmer.md)
5. install AVR toolset and AVRDUDE on macOS
6. compile the blinking LED program
7. flash the microship
8. optionally: [set the microship fuse bits](set-fuses.md)

After the above steps you may high five yourself to celebrate your success!
