## Getting started

So, we're going to make a LED blink by using and AVR microcontroller. How hard can it be, right? It's actully not that hard but involves quite a few steps. You need to:

* buy an AVR programmer (or make your own with an Arduino UNO)
* make sure you have all parts needed
* build the curcuit
* install AVR toolset and AVRDUDE on OS X
* compile the blinking LED program
* flash the microship
* optionally: [set the microship fuse bits](fuses.md)

After the above steps you may high five yourself to celebrate.
