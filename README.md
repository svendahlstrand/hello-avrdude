# Hello AVRDUDE!

Do you want to get up and running with AVR development on macOS? Maybe you're like me and have a history of Arduino development and want to cut the cord? Or maybe not.

Anyway, this repository contains everything you need to get a blinking LED program (the Hello World of microcontrollers) running on an AVR chip (like the ATmega328p):

* Source code for a blinking LED program (`src/blinking-led.c`).
* A simple `Makefile` for compiling the project and flash your AVR microcontroller.
* Easy to follow instructions for getting everything setup in macOS and using a programmer to flash your microcontroller.

What are you waiting for? [Get started](docs/start-here.md)!
